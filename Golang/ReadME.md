## Running/excutinng a GO file

The ".go" file extension is used for GO Lang source code. 

``` 
$ go run file.go
```
is used to compile and run go source Code. But it's doesn't create a binary executable file (.exe file). It simply execute the program.

If you want to create binary executable file than you can run
```
$ go build file.go
```

It will create file.exe file in the same directory.
