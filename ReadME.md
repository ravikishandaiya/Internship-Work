# Set-up terraform
* I am using window
	
## Download & install terraform: 
	https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html

## Verify the installation: 

for verification we can run "terraform -help" command and ensure that your PATH variable contains the directory where Terraform is installed.

terraform has these four main commands.
	
### "terraform init"
The terraform init command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files.
	
### "terraform plan"
The terraform plan command is used to create an execution plan. Terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files.
	
### "terraform apply"
The terraform apply command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a terraform plan execution plan.
	
### "terraform destroy"
The terraform destroy command terminates resources defined in your Terraform configuration. This command is the reverse of terraform apply in that it terminates all the resources specified by the configuration. It does not destroy resources running elsewhere that are not described in the current configuration.
