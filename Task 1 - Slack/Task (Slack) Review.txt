-> Does the application provide APIs for user management?
    Yes, slack provides API for user management and other actions.

-> Are APIs for user management available in our plan?
    No, for my plan I can't perform a user management operation. It requires an enterprise workspace.

-> How does the API do authentication - basic, static token, JWT, OAuth ?
    It's the same as zoom. We build an app in the workspace and that provides a JWT token.
