    -> Are APIs for user management available in our plan?
        No, for my plan I can't perform a user management operation. It requires an enterprise workspace.

    -> How does the API do authentication - basic, static token, JWT, OAuth ?
        It's the same as zoom. We build an app in the workspace and that provides a JWT token.

Make the API work:
    For Postman we need enterprise edition.
