Discovery:
    1. Does the application provide APIs for user management?
        Yes, slack provides API for user management and other actions.

    2. Are APIs for user management available in our plan?
        No, for my plan I can't perform a user management operation. It requires an enterprise workspace.

    3. How does the API do authentication - basic, static token, JWT, OAuth ?
        It's the same as zoom. We build an app in the workspace and that provides a JWT token.

Make the API work:
    For user management operation using Postman we need enterprise edition.
